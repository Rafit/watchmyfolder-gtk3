Why do this?
------------
Many businesses use laptops with offline files to provide off
site access to their network. Offline files was a lot better
in Windows 7 but still has a lot of reliability issues and has
caused a lot of issues over the last few years.

For organisations that still want mobile access to files but
are sick of the bugs caused by offline files Watch My Folder
is the solution!

About
-----
This simple program will watch a specified location and create a 1:1 backup of this folder.

 * Make shadow copies of individual files.
 * Mark deleted files after they are removed from the source folder.
